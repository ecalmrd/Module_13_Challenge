## Description
I modified the starter code of an e-commerce site's back-end application, incorporating an Express.JS API that employs Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database.

## Installation
To begin, launch VS Code and access the terminal. Then, enter MySQL to source the schema and exit the schema. Proceed by running NPM RUN SEED to seed the database and subsequently, NPM start to initiate listening to your local server. Next, use Insomnia to interact with the categories, products, or tags routes by performing operations such as GET, POST, PUT, or DELETE.

You can enter the following address in Insomnia to interact with the routes:
* localhost:3001/api/categories 
* localhost:3001/api/products 
* localhost:3001/api/tags
